Use the gravity force of your fingers to collect 137 flying space objects into the screen.
The game is to keep your finger on the screen and to observe how the gravity force is moving the objects.
You could move your finger in order to cross the orbit of an object and to collect them faster.
Sometimes you have to release the objects and to collect them all again.
There are a few levels. After each level the objects become a bit faster and the space is increasing.

The game is supporting different playing levels as well as more other features, like:
1. High scores - keeps track of your best score.
2. Supports different color palettes for different tastes.
3. Supports tablets and phones.
4. Increasing difficulties.

Your feedback and/or review is more than welcome.
